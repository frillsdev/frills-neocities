## Things I've been doing

<div class="pb-2">
  <details>
    <summary>
    🚣 Kayak training with the dog.
    </summary>
    It was in the shallows but the water was rapid so I was nervous I was going to float away! The dog did amazing though, I thought she would be spooked because she is terrible in the car, and this is also a vehicle that moves, but she was excited and handled the kayak moving really well. Lots of treats were had. Next time we'll go on deeper but calmer waters.

    <summary>🎨️ Finished painting the garden fence.</summary>
    Just the gate fence to go now. the weather has really been in my favour and I need to hurry up to finish it because the rain will surely come back soon!
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>👩‍💻 Giving eleventy a go.</summary>
    I have a github repo where it is very much the basic fork but it's progress. I've dabbled with Hugo in the past but 11ty seems really stable and fast. And I want to be able to create templates for this personal internet space.

  <details>
    <summary>🌕 Moon sea dip.</summary>
    I haven't sea dipped for about 8 months, since before the clocks went back for winter. Completely forgot about the happy chemicals it makes. I was buzzing after and slept very very well
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>✅ Completed a follow up survey with the ONS.</summary>
    Our answers had mostly not changed from March. But I found it really tough as someone with auditory processing difficulties, the bad phone line and the lady with the strong Spanish accent made my brain go ouch.

  <details>
    <summary>🕸️ Watched Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse in the cinema.</summary>
    Adore the art styles. Big old set up for SV 3. 10/10. Threw a lot of popcorn at my face.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>🌊️ Sunrise sea dip.</summary>
    Got up at 4am to dip in the sea for sunrise. Sea was so far out I nearly lost my crocs in the mud a few times on the wade in. The north easterly wind is brutal, and I ended up getting chill from being exposed for too long, had to wrap up in my oodie and a scarf for a few hours.

## Things I haven't been doing

<details>
  <summary>🏠 ️Keeping the house tidy.</summary>
  This has very much fallen by the wayside. I got into a bad mental health patch and it always reflects in my home, but now it's a little too overwhelming to sort.

<details>
  <summary>💬 toki pona.</summary>
  I got all excited about it. and was enamoured by it's simplicity, but the practicality of it being used for anything or with anyone made me feel like I was wasting time when I could be learning a more relevant language to me, like Welsh.
