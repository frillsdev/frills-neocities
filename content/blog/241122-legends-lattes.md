Finally finished [Legends & Lattes, by Travis Baldree](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61242426-legends-lattes).

The premise is an Orc adventurer hangs up her sword (literally) to open a coffee shop, an exotic gnomish invention.

I feel like my Half-Orc rogue, Thokk, would do something similiar once they tired of adventuring.

At the back of the book is a short story called Pages to Fill which explains how Viv, our new barista, came across coffee in the gnomish metropolis of Azimuth.

Very cosy, very warm, very <attr title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&D</attr>.

I think there are lots of stories and legends to tell of Viv the barbarian, both future and past. There is another book out called [Bookshops & Bonedust](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65213543-bookshops-bonedust), which is like the hobbit to the Lord of the Rings - I'll probably pick this up soon.
