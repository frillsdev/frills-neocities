Finally finished [Legends & Lattes, by Travis Baldree](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61242426-legends-lattes). Started in June, I put it down when I fell out of reading for the millionth time. But recently, on holiday abroad with the intention of chilling out, I packed it in my hand luggage and managed to finish it off.

The premise of the story is about an Orc adventurer that hangs up her sword (literally) to open a coffee shop, an exotic gnomish invention, meeting friends and more-than-friends along the way.

I feel like my Half-Orc rogue, Thokk, would do something similiar once they tired of adventuring.

At the back of the book is a short story called 'Pages to Fill' which explains how Viv, our new barista, came across coffee in the gnomish metropolis of Azimuth.

Very cosy, very warm, very <attr title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&D</attr>.

I think there are lots of stories and legends to tell of Viv the barbarian, both future and past. There is a prequel book out called [Bookshops & Bonedust](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65213543-bookshops-bonedust), which is like the Hobbit to the Lord of the Rings - I'll probably pick this up soon.
