For my sins, I play Overwatch. <em>A lot</em>.

I've been a filthy Mercy main for years. I could super jump before it was built into her toolkit; I was there when she had her mass rez.

For the uninitiated, Mercy mains get a bad rep as you don't need to be skilled in aiming. You point your staff in the direction of the player and the healing beam locks on.

However, I would say she's easy to learn but hard to master. Being a decent Mercy means you are tactical, you worry about placement, who to prioritise, when and who to damage boost.

In this new season of Overwatch, they have [Dokiwatch](https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24198671/the-art-and-style-of-dokiwatch/).

"Doki" is the Japanese onomatopeic word for a heartbeat. It is a magical girl take on the fem characters, and honestly, I have never loved a season so much. I am a complete and utter sucker for magical girl. When I had my brief stint of playing Final Fantasy XIV, I got mods sorted just so that I could play a [magical girl White Mage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmjw-4ZCPd4) that literally only I could see.

The new Overwatch Dokiwatch skins include a mythic skin for the Martian healer, Juno. She has a cute frilly skirt and is adorned with hearts, bows, ribbons and her Magitech form - sharks. Her abilities tinkle and sparkle in pink. It is the best thing.

After being a long-time Mercy main, I am finally stretching out and learning to aim so I can try to master Juno, because of course I wanna be a cute Heart of Hope.
