In the month of June, I complete a cycle around the sun one more time (I am, of course, a [Gemini](/blog/240614-gemini/)). The number ceaselessly increases like a child counting in a game of hide and seek.

Despite this continuous aging, I stay the same in many ways that I can’t change.

I stay up until 5am to play a video game made of cubes. Mining and crafting, mining and crafting.

People that have the night owl chronotype have a shifted wake times, prefer doing things in the evening or the dead of night than the break of dawn, although they may see the beginning of it if they push the midnight oil too far. Society favours morning larks, touting millionaires 5am routines that ‘seize the day’ as the reason they have made their dragon hoard. Night owls are left to flounder and bend their natural tendencies to work with this structure, often left scrabbling in the mornings and stealing extra hours at night.

I am a night owl. I sleep as far into the morning as I can before the rude awakening of capitalism pulls me out of my slumber to work away at my desk. I have made it work, we all do, but when I take Leave my rhythms wobble and bounce back to a night owl schedule like I haven’t spent the majority of my adult life training it not to.

Hobbies take hold and I am at the mercy of my brain not wanting to shut down, addicted to the neurons that fire when the sun sets. I push and push until the skies lighten and the birds begin their song. Then I know I have pushed it too far. I am tired but excited to be alive. Circadian Rebellion.
