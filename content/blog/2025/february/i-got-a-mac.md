Continuing on from my seemed [Apple-ification](/blog/2025/january/i-got-an-iphone/), I got a new Macbook!

Well, new to me.

I guess it's not that far from my norm as my personal daily driver was a Macbook, just a really ancient one. A [MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012)](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/111958) to be specific. Stuck on Catalina.

The last straw was not being able to install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).. and after support was dropped for Catalina for both Google Drive and Discord.. and not having any security patches and it generally struggling to exist in the current world of web and app features. It was Time.

My old Macbook (fondly named Dylan, I can't remember why) was already a refurb, and purchased for me through my first proper dev job. And to be fair, other than not getting any more updates, taking an age to boot up and having a poor webcam (I use it for my weekly family video calls), it was and is a solid piece of tech. I just need a bit more power and to be able to download newer apps.

And as with my iPhone:
> Itâ€™s been a lovely experience so far.
