Itâ€™s been a lovely experience so far.

The speakers are insanely good, the camera is delicious, the haptics are so gentle and satisfying, FindMy and AirTags are life changing,

It is heavier than I am used to, roughly 50 grams heavier than my previous daily driver, the Pixel 5. Iâ€™ve yet to have a phone-on-face injury.

I have not owned an iPhone in a very long time and I havenâ€™t purchased brand new in even longer, itâ€™s all very novel.
