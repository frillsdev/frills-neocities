It’s been a lovely experience so far.

The speakers are insanely good, the camera is delicious, the haptics are so gentle and satisfying, FindMy and AirTags are life changing,

It is heavier than I am used to, roughly 50 grams heavier than my previous daily driver, the Pixel 5. I’ve yet to have a phone on face injury yet.

I have not owned an iPhone in a very long time and I haven’t purchased brand new in even longer, it’s all very novel.
