I watched Roald Dahl’s The Witches. It’s on BBC iPlayer which is a win. No faffing with extra streaming platforms or subscriptions.

I cast it to my telly from my iPhone using AirPlay (again, nice and smooth!) but the subtitles didn’t seem to cast as well, they showed up on my phone independently. Need to investigate that.

Anyway.. The Witches. Anne Hathaway made a very palatable grand high witch. And the mice were very cute. I love Olivia Spencer. The transformation from human to mouse gave me Willy Wonka vibes, it might have been the purple.

I have no memory of reading the book but looking at the artwork on the front cover - illustrated by Quentin Blake - gives me the heebie-jeebies. So maybe I have read it, but I have squashed the memory way down.
