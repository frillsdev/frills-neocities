Thereâ€™s a certain kind of hush before Spring arrives. A breath held in the Earth, a quiet whisper of green waiting beneath frost-bitten soil. And then, one day, a crocus peeks through. The air carries the faintest warmth, the kind that hints at longer days and softer evenings. This is Ostara.

Ostara <i>(oh-STAH-rah)</i>, the 'vernal equinox', is the great in-between. Balanced, fleeting, and full of promise for what is coming. Named after [Ä’ostre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%92ostre), an ancient Germanic goddess of dawn and renewal, this Pagan festival is the moment when light and dark share the sky in equal measure. From here, the scales tip, and the sun lingers a little longer each evening, coaxing life back into the Northern Hemisphere.

Itâ€™s a festival of possibility. Eggs, symbols of fertility and new beginnings, are dyed in bright, joyful colors. Seeds, both literal and metaphorical, are planted with the hope that they will take root and grow. Hares and rabbits scamper through folklore and fields alike, carrying whispers of abundance and wild magic. Even the Easter traditions many grew up with - painted eggs, chocolate bunnies, baskets brimming with sweets - are echoes of this ancient celebration.

For those who mark the turning of the Wheel of the Year, Ostara is a time to wake up gently. Thereâ€™s no need for grand resolutions or drastic upheavals. Instead, itâ€™s an invitation to stretch toward the sun, to step outside and feel the earth, soft beneath your feet. Perhaps itâ€™s a morning spent planting herbs in a windowsill pot. Or an afternoon walk where you count the buds just beginning to open. Maybe itâ€™s simply lighting a candle at dusk, watching the flame flicker in quiet honor of the balance shifting.

Spring, after all, doesnâ€™t arrive all at once. It stirs slowly, stretches carefully, unfurls in its own time. And so can we.

Happy Ostara. May your days be lengthened by the light.
