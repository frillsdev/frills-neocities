In fact, I’ve written countless replies to early-career folks about documenting their learning journey <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/cyber-clout#blog\">via a blog</a>. Since I first founded <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/\">shellsharks</a> (<em>circa 2019</em>), I’ve devoted a fair bit of time not only to writing “content” but also into a lot of little features that, to me, collectively gave the site depth as well as that sense of “having everything a site <em>should</em> have”. Some of these features include, an <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/feeds/feed.xml\">RSS feed</a>, <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/robots.txt\">robots.txt</a>, <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/humans.txt\">humans.txt</a>, <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/.well-known/security.txt\">security.txt</a>, <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/about\">about</a> page, <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/tags\">tags</a>, search, <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/changelog\">change log</a>, <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/disclaimer\">license &amp; disclaimer</a> and more. I’ve poured my creativity, whimsy and mind into the aesthetic, writing and functionality of the site and as a result it has served as an ever-present source of identity and pride for me on the web.</p><p>Recently, I was introduced to the concept of the “<a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/indieweb#indieweb\">IndieWeb</a>” (or <em>small web</em>), a “<em>people-focused alternative to the corporate web</em>”. Intriguing right? My curiosity piqued, I soon discovered <a href=\"https://indieweb.org\">IndieWeb.org</a>, an organization dedicated to the proliferation of IndieWeb resources, guides, community and more. They describe the IndieWeb as…</p><blockquote><p>…a community of independent &amp; personal websites connected by simple standards, based on the principles of: owning your domain &amp; using it as your primary identity, publishing on your own site (optionally syndicating elsewhere), and owning your data. <strong>1</strong></p></blockquote><p><em>Sound familiar?</em> Sounds kinda like what I’ve been doing with my site for a while now! But what makes the IndieWeb special? Why should you or I care? Is there anything else to it? Read on to learn more! </p><span><img src=\"https://shellsharks.com/assets/img/buttons/shellsharks-button.gif\" alt=\"shellsharks-button.gif\" /></span><h1>IndieWeb</h1><p>The <strong><a href=\"https://indieweb.org\">IndieWeb</a></strong> (or “<a href=\"https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/\">small web</a>”) is a collection of people-focused websites which share a core set of <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/principles\">principles</a>. The IndieWeb is not simply a missionless multitude however, the IndieWeb <em>movement</em> is all about reclaiming the web by de-centralizing what has become all too centralized, encouraging ownership (of your site and your content), and bringing a truer sense of <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/indieweb#the-delightful-small-web\">fun and individuality</a> back to the Internet. So <em><a href=\"https://indieweb.org/why\">why</a></em> is the IndieWeb important? I’d suggest reading the following pieces by <a href=\"https://dangillmor.com/2014/04/25/indie-web-important/\">Dan Gillmor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/10/20/indieweb-talk/\">Jamie Tanna</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://ariadne.space/2022/07/01/a-silo-can-never-provide-digital-autonomy-to-its-users/\">Ariadne Conill</a>, as they do a far more eloquent job than I probably would in explaining this. <strong>1, 2</strong></p><p>I’ve previously made known <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/you-should-blog#so-why-blog\">my reasons for blogging</a>, but now with a better understanding of the IndieWeb, and <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/threadiversal-travel#title\">what’s at stake</a> if we don’t embrace it, I now recognize that my infinitesimally small slice of the Internet guarantees me an incorruptible continuum for my content and my identity on the web. (<em>Check out my <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/indieweb.txt\">IndieWeb.txt</a> file!</em>)</p><p><em>Awesome</em>! Now that we have a rough understanding of the IndieWeb ethos, let’s cover what is in my mind the <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/indieweb#principle-mechanics\">principle mechanics of the IndieWeb</a>.</p><h2>Principle Mechanics</h2><p>This section does not provide exhaustive coverage of how to implement <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/indieweb#indieweb\">IndieWeb</a> functionality. Instead, I simply summarize five core primitives which I feel comprise an IndieWeb site. For a more <em>official</em> gauge on where a site scores within the IndieWeb spectrum, consider leveraging <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/indieweb#indiemark\">IndieMark</a>!</p><ul><li><p><strong>Hosting</strong>: You need a place to <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/blogging-from-ipad\">host your site</a> and store your content. There are <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/web_hosting\">a lot of great options</a> out there. Ideally, choose one that allows you the ability to make some under-the-hood changes and does not limit your content portability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Syndication</strong>: Share your content with the world! There are two preferred methods for syndication, <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/PESOS\">PESOS</a> and <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/POSSE\">POSSE</a>. <a href=\"https://elizabethtai.com/2023/07/02/posse-and-pesos-better-ways-to-publish-content/\">This resource</a> does a great job explaining both! For more examples of how this is done, check <a href=\"https://elizabethtai.com/2023/07/03/how-i-am-blogging-the-indieweb-way/\">this</a> and <a href=\"https://kevquirk.com/how-it-all-connects\">this</a> out. <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/an-ode-to-rss#title\">RSS is a great starting point</a> for helping others subscribe to new content on your site.</p></li><li><p><strong>Writing</strong>: Though your site <em>could</em> simply serve as a more static point/identity on the web, with little to no “content” being regularly added, I recommend <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/you-should-blog\">writing</a>!</p></li><li><p><strong>Interactivity</strong>: One of the more advanced concepts within the IndieWeb world, the ability to bake in native comments, replies, likes, etc is a greay way to build community. This interactivity helps mitigate reliance on centralized social networks for communication within Indie communities. One example of IndieWeb interactivity is <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Webmention\">Webmentions</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Identity</strong>: Make it unique, make it fun, make it yours. The corporate web is sterile and suffocating. Let’s bring back the <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/indieweb#the-delightful-small-web\">whimsy of the old web</a>.</p></li></ul><h6>IndieMark</h6><p><strong><a href=\"https://indieweb.org/IndieMark\">IndieMark</a></strong> is a progressive set of requirements (from <a href=\"https://indieweb.org\">IndieWeb.org</a>) which provide quantitative and level-based measurement of the <em>indieweb-ness</em> of a site. As discussed <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/notes/2024/05/14/one-of-us\">here</a>, I’ve decided to not benchmark my site with IndieMark.</p><h2>The Delightful Small Web</h2><p>The Internet is vast, yet collectively we spend most of our time these days (sadly) within boring, behemoth, centralized corporate-web watering holes. Beyond the corporate web lies countless relics of the old web, unique destinations of the IndieWeb and <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/indieweb#indieweb-delights\">delights</a> of the small web.</p><h3>Webrings</h3><p>A <strong><a href=\"https://indieweb.org/webring\">webring</a></strong> is a collection of websites that are linked together, each pointing to and from another site in the ring.

Now that we have a rough understanding of the IndieWeb ethos, let’s cover what is in my mind the principle mechanics of the IndieWeb.Principle MechanicsThis section does not provide exhaustive coverage of how to implement IndieWeb functionality. Instead, I simply summarize five core primitives which I feel comprise an IndieWeb site. For a more official gauge on where a site scores within the IndieWeb spectrum, consider leveraging IndieMark!Hosting: You need a place to host your site and store your content. There are a lot of great options out there. Ideally, choose one that allows you the ability to make some under-the-hood changes and does not limit your content portability.Syndication: Share your content with the world! There are two preferred methods for syndication, PESOS and POSSE. This resource does a great job explaining both! For more examples of how this is done, check this and this out. RSS is a great starting point for helping others subscribe to new content on your site.Writing: Though your site could simply serve as a more static point/identity on the web, with little to no “content” being regularly added, I recommend writing!Interactivity: One of the more advanced concepts within the IndieWeb world, the ability to bake in native comments, replies, likes, etc is a greay way to build community. This interactivity helps mitigate reliance on centralized social networks for communication within Indie communities. One example of IndieWeb interactivity is Webmentions.Identity: Make it unique, make it fun, make it yours. The corporate web is sterile and suffocating. Let’s bring back the whimsy of the old web.IndieMarkIndieMark is a progressive set of requirements (from IndieWeb.org) which provide quantitative and level-based measurement of the indieweb-ness of a site. As discussed here, I’ve decided to not benchmark my site with IndieMark.The Delightful Small WebThe Internet is vast, yet collectively we spend most of our time these days (sadly) within boring, behemoth, centralized corporate-web watering holes. Beyond the corporate web lies countless relics of the old web, unique destinations of the IndieWeb and delights of the small web.WebringsA webring is a collection of websites that are linked together, each pointing to and from another site in the ring. They serve as a fun way to build community and facilitate discovery of new sites!
