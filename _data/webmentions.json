It is an online commonplace book. He links to a lot, logs a little bit of everything, and is all around a strange place online. I don't read it much, but I find the idea very interesting.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Chris Coyier <a href=\"https://chriscoyier.net/\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://chriscoyier.net/feed/\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Chris Coyier used to own CSS-Tricks so you know he has some insight into the web.

Really good reads from what I've seen.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Dave Rupert <a href=\"https://daverupert.com\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://daverupert.com/atom.xml\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Dave Rupert talks about web dev and his life. He also keeps a nice page documenting all the books he has read and a page with his own stories he has written. I need to catch up on his stuff as I've not been checking his feed as often as some others.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Devastatia <a href=\"https://devastatia.com/\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://devastatia.com/rss\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Devastatia's website is NSFW in a self-aware edgy kind of way and I see it as a bit of a parody of everything the corporate hates. If you are uncomfortable with images of scantly clad women and sexual language I'd say you might not want to read her stuff. She talks a lot about the web as a whole, some mild politics, and philosophy. There is a lot of insight on her site if you look past the sexual humor.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Frills <a href=\"https://frills.dev/\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://frills.dev/all.xml\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Frills is a new addition added to my RSS feed. I found her via 32-bit Cafe. Her website captures a lot of the feel people want when they think positively about the old web. An awesome personal website.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Garrit Franke <a href=\"https://garrit.xyz\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://garrit.xyz/rss.xml\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Garrit Franke posts about tech, but also life stuff like dive logs and notes on media he consumes. I haven't really dived deep into his stuff yet, but overall good from what I've seen.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          James Savage <a href=\"https://axiixc.com/\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://axiixc.com/feed.xml\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>James Savage posts a lot of Weeknotes. They are little posts with updates on what he did and what happened that week. I like the idea quite a bit.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          James' Coffee Blog <a href=\"https://jamesg.blog/\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://jamesg.blog/feeds/posts.xml\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>James posts about the IndieWeb, AI vision, his insecurities, coffee, and a little bit of everything else. His blog is really well thought out and very personal. I still need to catch up on all his recent posts, but they are always worth reading.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Jim Nielsen's Blog <a href=\"https://blog.jim-nielsen.com\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/feed.xml\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Jim Nielsen talks a lot about tech as many of these blogs do, but he also has book notes and bits on culture as a whole. He also has been blogging for a while so his archive is fairly large, I've not made much of a dent in it yet. Another great personal website.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Kev Quirk <a href=\"https://kevquirk.com\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://kevquirk.com/feed.rss\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Kev Quirk really makes his website personal and it is wonderful for that. He talks about tech, his hobbies (including the website), and his life in general.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Lynn Fisher <a href=\"https://lynnandtonic.com\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://lynnandtonic.com/feed.xml\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Lynn updates her website every year with a fun and interesting design experiment. She is a master of interesting CSS. Her blog is split between a personal website blog and a more developer focused one.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Manuel Moreale <a href=\"https://manuelmoreale.com\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://manuelmoreale.com/feed/rss\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Manuel blogs a lot about blogging, the personal web, and random moments in his life. He is one of the first blogs I found when discovering the IndieWeb.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Matthias Ott <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/feed\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Matthias Ott writes a lot about the IndieWeb and general personal webmastering. If you want to run a website or are interested in those who do his blog is one to follow.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Max Böck <a href=\"https://mxb.dev\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://mxb.dev/feed.xml\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Max Böck writes infrequent, but well thought out posts about the web.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Michał Sapka <a href=\"https://michal.sapka.me/\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://michal.sapka.me/index.xml\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Michał Sapka writes about media he watches, BSD, Emacs, and tech in general. I've not read enough of his stuff to really say much on the his media posts, but I have read some of his other posts and they are good.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Nicco Loves Linux <a href=\"https://blog.nicco.love/\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://blog.nicco.love/rss/\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Nicco is a Youtuber and KDE developer who covers a lot of KDE developments, Linux in general, and is all around a nice guy. He is sometimes political, but generally it is related to human rights and in theory shouldn't be controversial.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Nicole Tietz-Sokolskaya's Blog <a href=\"https://ntietz.com/\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://www.ntietz.com/atom.xml\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Nicole Tietz-Sokolskaya talks about everything from tech to mental health and life in general. A lot of good long form writing to be seen here. Give her some of your time.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Rach Smith's Digital Garden <a href=\"https://rachsmith.com/\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://rachsmith.com/rss/\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Rach Smith's website is full of little bits of wisdom, personal stories, and tech.

He has many posts about music, video games, projects he is working on, and more. I think I found his site from a link to one of his projects on another blog, he makes a lot of cool things.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Rubenerd <a href=\"https://rubenerd.com/\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://rubenerd.com/feed/\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Ruben Schade covers a little bit of everything; BSD, life in Sydney, blogging, geek culture, retro tech, and more. He usually covers things with a good amount of wit and snark so it is always fun to read.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Sara Joy <a href=\"https://sarajoy.dev/\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://sarajoy.dev/rss.xml\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Sara Joy does a lot with her website. She has a blog full of great long form content that is both personal and technical, but she also has a microblog for short posts and a section showing off her projects. It is a fun website for sure.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Simone Silvestroni's Minutes to Midnight <a href=\"https://minutestomidnight.co.uk\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/feed.xml\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Simone Silvestroni covers a lot of topics. A lot of he he posts is related to the IndieWeb, sustainability, accessibility, and music. One of the first sites I found during my initial exploration of the Indieweb. He also has his own music on his site so give that a listen.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Starbreaker <a href=\"https://starbreaker.org\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://starbreaker.org/feed.xml\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Starbreaker's personal blog covers a little of everything from the personal web to politics. He also writes fiction, but I have yet to read any. He is one of the first blogs I found when discovering the personal/IndieWeb. He rarely holds anything back so I would say don't read if you are thin skinned or on a work computer.</p>\n        </li>\n      \n        <li>\n          Terence Eden's Blog <a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog\"><span>Website</span><span></span></a> <a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/feed/atom/\"><span>RSS</span><span></span></a>\n          <p>Terence Eden writes about tech, politics, reviews of products, and a little  bit of everything.

If you are uncomfortable with images of scantly clad women and sexual language I'd say you might not want to read her stuff. She talks a lot about the web as a whole, some mild politics, and philosophy. There is a lot of insight on her site if you look past the sexual humor.\n        \n      \n        \n          Frills Website RSS\n          Frills is a new addition added to my RSS feed.

His blog is really well thought out and very personal. I still need to catch up on all his recent posts, but they are always worth reading.\n        \n      \n        \n          Jim Nielsen's Blog Website RSS\n          Jim Nielsen talks a lot about tech as many of these blogs do, but he also has book notes and bits on culture as a whole. He also has been blogging for a while so his archive is fairly large, I've not made much of a dent in it yet. Another great personal website.\n        \n      \n        \n          Kev Quirk Website RSS\n          Kev Quirk really makes his website personal and it is wonderful for that.

She also keeps her website minimal while looking amazing.\n        \n      \n        \n          Robb Knight's Blog Website RSS\n          Robb Knight writes a little about everything. He has many posts about music, video games, projects he is working on, and more. I think I found his site from a link to one of his projects on another blog, he makes a lot of cool things.\n        \n      \n        \n          Rubenerd Website RSS\n          Ruben Schade covers a little bit of everything; BSD, life in Sydney, blogging, geek culture, retro tech, and more.
